# Privacy Policy in Plain English

There are five account types, which have varying privacy rights on the site. Those are:
- **Guest/Anonymous** which unregistered users
- **Registered Users** who have provided and verified their email addresses
- **Paid Users** who have provided and verified their email addresses, and who pay for a monthly subscription fee
- **Subsidized Users** who get the rights of paid users, but who have instead opted to allow us to share their email address with marketers
- **Administrative Users** who manage the website

By default, visits to this site are not anonymous, and the following services are able to log your visits:

- We use Google Analytics from Alphabet, Inc., so Alphabet will have visibility into which pages you visit and 
    how long you stay on each page.
    
- In addition, we utilize Matomo for additional analytics and insight to visitor behavior. Our instance of Matomo is 
    self-hosted and data from that is never shared.
  
- We use Google Ads from Alphabet, Inc., which displays relevant ads based on the profile that Alphabet has generated for you
  
- We load the following shared libraries from the following Content Delivery Networks (CDN's):
  - JQuery is loaded from code.jquery.com
  - Bootstrap CSS and Javascript are both loaded from maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com
  - We utilize FontAwesome's webfonts, which are loaded from use.fontawesome.com

Paid and subsidized users are able to turn off Google Analytics and Google Advertising, and can turn off loading asset 
from free content delivery networks, all of which *can* increase your privacy.

## Email privacy
A valid email address is required to create an account on this site, and we will use that email address to send account 
management messages, such as activation links, password resets.

We will not share your email address with anyone, unless you specifically opt-in. Opting in to allowing us to share your 
email address with marketers can help subsidize the subscription cost of having a paid account.

By default, your email address is hidden from all end-users of the site. Administrators are able to view your email address.
You can choose whether to make your email address visible to other registered users.
