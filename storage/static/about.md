[Retail Diligence](http://example.com) is a website where retail investors can come together to share
our investment ideas with each other, the idea being that we'll get feedback from each other that can help us
learn new facts about the companies and funds that we want to invest in.

Hedge funds, mutual funds and other investment professionals  already have the benefit of working in teams to
conduct due diligence before presenting their ideas to their investment committees. Retail investors, on the
other hand, toil away on their individual islands, attempting to glean actionable information on our own.

No reason for you to not continue using those sites. In fact, due diligence that you post on Retail Diligence
can easily be shared on other platforms to reach a larger universe of eyes. The goal for Retail Diligence is to create
a more structured experience than the major social media platforms. In addition, research will not be put behind a pay wall,
meaning that it's accessible to all.
